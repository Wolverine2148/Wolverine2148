ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Wolverine2148
I have kept this name as it is the same name I go by on my Xbox profile.
I've recently started programming with the help of a 100 Days Python bootcamp, available on Udemy to whoever is interested.
As I start learning new concepts and making new projects, I will be uploading them here on Github for the entire community to see my progress and to remind me to follow through with all 100 days.


I hope my projects keep progressing as the days go on, and also help others who need them.




P.S.:
I'm not that good.
